# Website-Frontend-Clone

I replicated the frontend of an existing website using HTML and Tailwind CSS. Leveraging Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach, I efficiently styled
the elements to closely mimic the design and layout of the original site. By dissecting the structure and styling nuances of the target website, I
honed my skills in HTML for markup and Tailwind CSS for rapid and responsive styling. This project not only reinforced my understanding of
frontend development principles but also showcased my ability to recreate complex designs with precision and efficiency.
